# Demo script

A 7–10 minute walkthrough of the UK Liveability Index for stakeholders, run from a
laptop. The assistant prompts below are recorded in [config/demo.yaml](../config/demo.yaml),
so the same demo also runs offline.

## Before you start

```bash
make demo           # real model from .env; opens http://localhost:3000
make demo-offline   # the recorded conversations; no network or model key needed
make down           # stop
```

- Data: `data/serve` from `make build-data`, or a data pack (`make data-unpack PACK=...`).
- Model: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env`. Claude Haiku 5.5 answers in about 4 seconds,
  and Opus 5.5 in about 7 ([evals](evals.md)).
- Use a fresh browser profile (or clear site data) so the welcome card shows.
- Re-record the offline conversations after changing data or prompts: `make demo-record`.

## The story

| # | Do | You'll see | Say |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open the page | Every neighbourhood in England coloured by its England percentile; the welcome card | "33,755 neighbourhoods, about 40 open datasets: police, NHS, Ofsted, Land Registry, air quality, flood risk, broadband, bus timetables, pubs." |
| 2 | Click **Family with children** | The map recolours instantly | "Weights are a judgement, so they're yours to change. Scoring all of England takes a tenth of a second in the browser." |
| 3 | **Weights** tab: drag *Safety* to 3 | The map recolours as you drag | "No server round trip: the scores are recomputed on the page." |
| 4 | **Assistant**: *We have two young kids and a budget of £350k. Where should we look around Leeds?* | Sliders move to the family preset, a ranked list, outlined areas on the map; "close call" tags | "The assistant uses the same tools and data as the page. It never makes numbers up: every figure comes from a tool. 'Close call' means a slightly different weighting could swap that area out." |
| 5 | Click the top result | Its profile: theme bars with council and England medians, strengths and weak spots, "better than X–Y% with slightly different weights" | "Transparent by design: a range, not a false precision, and the local benchmark." |
| 6 | *Compare Far Headingley and Chapel Allerton* | A side-by-side table | "Neighbourhoods, not single streets, for named places." |
| 7 | *Show me well-run pubs near LS6 3AA* | Pubs on the map and in a list | "Pubs that are open (in two independent sources) and rated 4–5 for food hygiene in the last three years. Honest about what it measures: how well run, not the beer." |
| 8 | *Why does Manchester city centre score low on safety?* | The score broken down by theme and indicator, with caveats and source dates | "It explains itself, including the caveats: Greater Manchester Police publishes no crime data, so it's estimated, and city centres have few residents but many visitors." |
| 9 | Search **Hebden Bridge** (top bar) | Flood risk listed as a weak spot | "Data people care about but rarely see together: 24% of homes here are at real flood risk." |
| 10 | Tick **Analyst**, open the **Analyst** tab | Distribution chart, indicator overlap heatmap, SQL console | "The same data for analysts: read-only SQL over every LSOA, exports with attribution." |
| 11 | Click **How scores work** → **Validation** | The method, the 25-place face-validity review, the assistant evals | "We test it: 49 face-validity checks, 30 assistant evals across three models." |

Optional extras (also recorded): *Tell me about Hebden Bridge*, *What are the best
areas in York for retirees?*, *Which areas of Birmingham have the fewest immigrants?*
(it declines and offers what it can do), and in analyst mode *Using SQL, list the 10
local authorities with the highest average gigabit broadband availability.*

## Rehearsal checklist

- [ ] Cold start after a reboot: `make demo` brings everything up and the map draws
- [ ] Wi-Fi off: `make demo-offline`; every story prompt answers (recorded)
- [ ] The welcome card appears in a fresh profile; "Skip" dismisses it for good
- [ ] Dark mode (system setting, and the header toggle): map, legend, cards, heatmap and the
      chat panel are all dark and readable; switching back to light restores everything
- [ ] A wrong postcode in search says "No matches in England"
- [ ] An ambiguous place (*Tell me about Clapham*) says which Clapham it used
- [ ] Model outage: unset the key or block the network with `make demo` running; the
      assistant explains in the chat and the map keeps working
- [ ] Phone width (390px) in the browser's device mode: search and profile still work

## If something goes wrong

- **The assistant is slow or down:** switch to `make demo-offline` (the story prompts
  are recorded), or carry on with search, the weights and the map, which don't need it.
- **The map is blank:** check `docker compose ps` (all healthy) and that `data/serve`
  has tiles (`make validate`).
- **A strange answer:** the [evals](evals.md) show the cases we test; every number on a
  card comes from the data, not the model.
