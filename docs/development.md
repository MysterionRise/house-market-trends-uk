# Development

How the project is put together and how to work on it. For running it, see the
[README](../README.md); for contributing, [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## The data pipeline

The pipeline downloads, stages and joins the open datasets below:

- `lix resolve` finds each source's current file and pins it in `config/datasets.lock.json`.
  ONS deletes Open Geography items whenever it publishes a new version, so those are found by
  search; GOV.UK files through the content API.
- `lix fetch` downloads what the lockfile pins (resumable, checksummed, rejects error pages served
  as data, waits out ArcGIS exports still being generated, extracts only the files it needs)
- `lix stage` turns each raw file into tidy Parquet in `data/staged/`
- `geo_lsoa` is the backbone every indicator joins onto: each England LSOA with its MSOA,
  local authority, region, friendly MSOA name, population-weighted centroid, urban/rural class,
  population, area and map bounding box; `lix validate geo` checks it
- helpers bring other geographies onto LSOAs: points, output areas, MSOA/local-authority values,
  1km grids (sampled at postcodes, so population-weighted) and distance-based access to places
- `lix indicators` builds 64 indicators (31 scored across 8 themes) from
  [`config/indicators.yaml`](../config/indicators.yaml); `lix score` turns them into theme and
  overall scores per LSOA for five persona presets ([`config/weights.yaml`](../config/weights.yaml)),
  plus a QA report. The method, including how Greater Manchester's missing crime data and
  Ofsted's framework changes are handled, is in [docs/methodology.md](methodology.md)
- CI runs ruff and pytest on every push and PR to `master` (tests never touch the network);
  a nightly job checks every source is still reachable

## API and assistant

`make api` (or `uv run lix-api`) serves, on http://localhost:8000:

- a REST API under `/api/v1`: place search, area profiles, rankings with any weights and
  filters, comparisons, nearest places (GPs, schools, well-run pubs, ...), score explanations,
  the indicator catalogue and read-only SQL (docs at `/docs`)
- an AI assistant at `/agent` speaking [AG-UI](https://docs.ag-ui.com), built with
  [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev): its tools return typed results the front end renders as
  maps, cards and tables, and it moves the map and weight sliders through shared state
- an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server at `/mcp` with the same tools, for Claude
  Desktop and other MCP clients

The model is set with `LIX_MODEL`: `openrouter:...` (one `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for many
providers; the default), `anthropic:...`, `openai:...`, `google:...` or `ollama:...`.
`LIX_MODEL=test` runs a scripted assistant that needs no API key, and without a key the
recorded demo answers stand in. See [.env.example](../.env.example). Each question is capped
(model requests, tool calls, tokens), and so are conversations, questions per minute and
spend per day (`api/src/lix_api/agent/limits.py`); a refusal, a failure or a missing key is
explained in the chat while the map keeps working, and every turn is logged to
`data/logs/agent.jsonl` (tools called, latency, tokens, what the provider billed).

The assistant has an eval suite ([api/evals/cases.yaml](../api/evals/cases.yaml): about 30 cases
covering ranking with constraints, look-ups, follow-ups, ambiguous places, out-of-scope and
discriminatory requests, numbers grounded in tool results, analyst SQL and prompt injection):

```bash
make eval MODEL=openrouter:anthropic/claude-haiku-5.5 CASES=family_leeds_budget,compare_two
make eval MODEL=openrouter:anthropic/claude-haiku-5.5    # all cases, about $0.05
```

Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Haiku 5.5 and Qwen 3.8 27B (open weights) all pass the 30 cases;
results, costs and what the evals caught are in [docs/evals.md](evals.md).

## Stakeholder demo

A 7–10 minute stakeholder walkthrough, with talking points and a rehearsal checklist, is in
[docs/demo.md](demo.md):

```bash
make demo           # Docker, real model from .env, opens http://localhost:3000
make demo-offline   # recorded conversations (config/demo_cassettes.json): no network needed
make demo-record    # re-record them after changing data or prompts
```

`LIX_DEMO=1 LIX_E2E_STACK=docker npx playwright test demo-storyline` (in `web/`) rehearses
the storyline against a running demo and saves a screenshot per step. `make gif` records the
README's GIFs and the release's walkthrough video the same way (needs ffmpeg), and
`make tiktok` the vertical, TikTok-style clip of the phone layout
([web/scripts/tiktok.mjs](../web/scripts/tiktok.mjs)).

## Docker

```bash
make up          # everything at http://localhost:3000 (LIX_PORT), data from ./data/serve
make up BUILD=1  # build the images from this checkout instead of pulling the release's
make up-demo     # the same on the committed demo dataset (fixtures/demo: Leeds + Brighton)
make down
```

One Caddy proxy ([docker/Caddyfile](../docker/Caddyfile)) is the only published port: it
serves the data files under `/data`, sends `/api/v1`, `/health` and `/mcp` to the API and
everything else to the web app, so the same images work on any host.

The data pack: `make data-pack` on a machine with a full build writes
`dist/lix-serve.tar.gz` (about 120 MB, with the licence notices); `make data-download`
fetches a release's pack and `make data-unpack` restores one you have. `make demo-data`
re-cuts the demo dataset from a full build, and `lix validate serve` checks any serve
directory (CI runs the browser tests on the demo data).

## Front end

`web/` is a Next.js app (Node 24, see `.nvmrc`):

- a MapLibre map of every England neighbourhood from static PMTiles, coloured by England
  percentile; weights are recomputed in the browser, so moving a slider recolours all 33,755
  areas in about 100 ms
- an assistant chat ([CopilotKit](https://copilotkit.ai) over AG-UI) whose tool calls render as
  components: ranked lists, area profiles, side-by-side comparisons, nearby places, score
  explanations and SQL results. The assistant and the page share state, so it can move the map,
  outline areas, set the weight sliders and save a shortlist, and it sees what you change
- presets (family, young professional, retired, commuter), a "compare like with like" switch for
  urban/rural fairness, a shortlist, shareable URLs, light and dark mode, and an analyst mode with
  a distribution chart, read-only SQL and CSV export

How it looks (tokens, the map ramp, theme colours, dark mode) is in [design.md](design.md);
`web/lib/palette.ts` is the source and `npm run tokens` regenerates the CSS.

```bash
make web-install   # npm ci (Node 24)
make dev           # API (model from .env, else the scripted assistant) + front end on :3000
make web-test      # typecheck, lint, unit tests (incl. scoring parity with Python)
make e2e           # browser tests (Playwright) against the local build
```

With a model key in `.env`, `make dev` uses the real model from `.env`.

## Planned

- More open datasets: rail service frequency, surface water flooding and road and rail noise
  (both published as rasters only), tree cover, and the CDRC's Access to Healthy Assets &
  Hazards (behind a free login)
- Walking-network travel times instead of straight-line distances

## Building the data

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Python 3.11+.

```bash
make install    # uv sync
make fetch      # download every dataset pinned in the lockfile (about 20 GB; Price Paid is 5.5 GB)
make stage      # stage every downloaded dataset to data/staged/*.parquet
make indicators # build the indicator table
make score      # theme/overall scores, browser files and QA report in data/serve/
make validate   # check the geography backbone, the serve files and the anchor places
make test       # pytest (no network access; HTTP is tested against a local server)
make lint       # ruff check + format check
```

Or step by step:

```bash
uv run lix resolve --all              # pick up new upstream versions (updates the lockfile)
uv run lix fetch --theme geography    # or --slug nspl, --priority P0, --all
uv run lix stage --all
uv run lix resolve --check --all      # is every source still reachable?
```

Set `LIX_DATA_DIR` to keep data somewhere other than `./data`.

## Layout

```
config/datasets.yaml    dataset URLs, formats, licences
core/                   lix_core: paths, config, logging, shared code patterns
api/                    lix_api: FastAPI, the AI assistant (AG-UI) and the MCP server
pipeline/               lix_pipeline and the `lix` CLI
web/                    Next.js front end: map, chat and generative UI components
contracts/              JSON Schema of the API models and the scoring golden cases
  fetch/http.py         download engine with caching and resume
  geo/                  NSPL postcode lookup, LSOA boundaries
  stage/                one stager per dataset (nspl, price_paid, iod)
data/                   raw/, staged/, ... (gitignored; rebuilt by the pipeline)
```

The Python side is a [uv workspace](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/)
(`core`, `pipeline`, `api`).
